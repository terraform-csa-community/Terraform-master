# Welcome to FSI Terraform Community!

More and more financial services customers are turning to declarative languages to help standardize their cloud deployments at scale. Terraform has begun to emerge as one of the go-to languages for companies that want to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IAC) within their Hybrid/Multi cloud environments. Terraform is a tool created by Hashicorp which has a deep partnership with Microsoft. This partnership has lead to an extremely robust Azure Provider (AzureRM) as well as integration directly into our Cloud Shell service. The purpose of this community is 3-fold:

1) We want to provide a space where CSAs can skill up on Terraform, providing field readiness for engagement with customers
2) We want to provide a repository of artifacts for quick and repeatable customer demos
3) We want to provide artifacts based on real world industry patterns that customers can use with little to no modifications

The below guide will walk you through all you need to get started on your terraform journey.

## How to use this community
There are 3 primary directories in this repository: Demos, Patterns & Success Stories. 

**Demos** - The artifacts in this directory will comprise of sample terraform scripts that enable you to and your customer to quickly spin up a POC environment for service evaluations. The Terraform configurations in this directory will be generic and are not intended to be used in production. Any configuration added to this directory should be generalized and simple. The goal is to quickly spin up foundational services with the anticipation of further modifying them after the fact. 

**Patterns** - This directory will focus on configurations that are specific to industry adopted patterns in architecture design. These will be opinion driven configurations with incorporated best practices. The goal is to provide customers near production ready implementations of common architectures. Any configuration added to this directory will be peer reviewed by a group of industry CSAs to ensure quality and alignment.

**Success Stories** - This directory will house previously successfully customer deployed workloads in the form of a matching configuration file. Customers are constantly finding creative ways to leverage cloud to meet business needs. Often these needs are not unique and the goal with these configurations are to reduce duplication of effort when it comes to implementing specific customer scenarios. This directory will only be updated with verified and published customer success stories for right now. 

## Getting Started With Terraform
If you are just getting started there is no better place than the Hashicorp learn site that will walk you though the fundamentals of Terraform as well as allow you to get your first deployment up and running.
